The code must be in a directory with 'Dbase/XXX.jpg' 

The original project included 140 facial images from grad students in 
Computer Vision at UNO. They were of various lighting and position.

Included in the original dataset was the left eye, right eye, and mouth
row and column indices.

Orig Task 1 can be ran with the following
Master (Non-affine transformed error checking)
affineMaster (Self Explanatory)

These will generate the error csv files as well as store way too
many variables (we finished debugging it at 5:45pm)

We also create and store Cropped, AffineCropped, and affineTransformed
pre-Cropped photo databases in directories

Task 2 
Is ran with runFaces code which will load Dbase images and process

Task 3 
part3 script
